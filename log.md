### Day 9: February 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  Worked on JS30 Day 2 Challenge. 

**Thoughts:** JS30 is a very good exercise since I'm using vanilla JS instead of frameworks. This helps in strengthening my fundamental concepts. Also, I'm working on the latest JS - ES6.

### Day 10: March 01, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** 

1. Began working on the Weather App for Momentum Project. Worked on API calls, geolocation. 

2. Completed Daily CSS Images Day 3 : Beaver. I had discontinued the challenge for a few days since I'm sticking to p1xt's guide for web development and also busy with the Momentum Project.

**Thoughts:** Global variables and callback functions were really hard work on. This takes me back to the YDKJS Books - I have to complete reading them as soon as possible.
