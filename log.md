**Today's Progress**: 

1. Tried setting up a Slack bot using node framework. Created a new Slack team (batman-bots.slack.com). Downloaded node.js and wrote a sample file index.js. But the bot is not sending messages to the channel. Will troubleshoot tomorrow. 
2. Continued working with @tan on the Weather App for Momentum - Almost complete. Have to add changing backgrounds depending on the weather.

**Thoughts** Excited to set up my own bot. I really want to succeed with this.
